# HOW TO SETUP ATTINY 13a

1- You need to upload ArduinoISP example code to your arduino to  make it able to program the  attiny.</br>
2- Then make sure to include attiny board core in your arduino IDE by putting this link <https://mcudude.github.io/MicroCore/package_MCUdude_MicroCore_index.json> in Additional Boards Manager URLs in prefrences of your IDE. </br>
3- Go to board manager and search about "attiny" and download it </br>
4- Since that was done select attiny board and put the BOD at 2.7 and the clock at 1.2 MHz internal osc and put programmer on Arduino as ISP.</br>
5- Finally program it as the following pinout ![attiny 13a pinout](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/f53f0c04f052aab3fddf233c6236154a1ee39ea4b64efe6ff1b1fc43f77cc52c/687474703a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f4a7362677550562e6a7067 "attiny 13a pinout")  </br>
